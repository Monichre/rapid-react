# Road Map :construction:

Really happy to see your interest in what **Rapid React** holds for the future! You are always welcome to suggest your inputs on the road map. Below is the curated list of upcoming changes lined up:

### Breaking Changes:

- Redux would be scaffolded using [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) APIs. This has been considered after an in-depth advice from [Mark Erikson](https://github.com/markerikson) who is a Redux maintainer. You may check his suggestion [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/vinaysharma-) which covers **RTK** as the recommended way to write Redux logic.

### New Features

- There would be a dedicated prompt to choose from and scaffold commonly used design libraries:

  - [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/)
  - [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
  - [Ant Design](https://ant.design/)
  - [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)
  - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
  - [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)

### Minor changes:

- Invalid names would be logged if entered for any of these: `Saga`, `Route`, `Folder`, `Reducer`, `MobX Store`, `Dependency`, `Dev Dependency`, etc.
