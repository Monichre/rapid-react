## About :information_source:

<a href="https://github.com/vinaysharma14/react-cli" target="_blank">@react/cli</a> is an interactive CLI tool which automates the repetitive steps involved every time a new React app is setup. Usually developers :man_technologist: go through a time consuming process which involves waiting for **create-react-app** to finish it's boilerplate setup, followed by installation of dependencies & dev dependencies, setup of folder structure, routing, state management, e.t.c. before it can finally start working on the app. :construction:

Well, now you can grab a cup of :coffee: while **@react/cli** scaffolds the app for you! :relieved:

## Features :tada:

- Supports both [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). :heart_eyes:
- Installs both dependencies and dev dependencies.
- Supports popularly used CSS preprocessor [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)! :fire:
- Choose from commonly used folders (`assets`, `components`, `hooks`, `services`, `utils`, e.t.c.) to scaffold.
- Scaffolds custom folder as well.
- Choose preferred [export type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/export): named/default. :thinking:
- Setups [routing](https://reactrouter.com/) with user defined routes.
- Setups [Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) state management with user defined reducers along with:
  - [Redux Saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/)
  - [Redux Form](https://redux-form.com/)
  - [Redux Logger](https://github.com/LogRocket/redux-logger#readme)
- Setups [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/README.html) state management with user defined stores.
- ...and much more! :tada:
